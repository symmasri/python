1)Define a class named Shape and its subclass Square. The Square class has an init function which takes a length as argument. 
Both classes have a area function which can print the area of the shape where Shape's area is 0 by default.


class Shape:
    area=0
    def __init__(self):
         self.length=length
        
class Square(Shape):
    def __init__(self,length):
        self.length = length

    def area(self):
        a = (self.length * self.length)
        print('The area of a square with a side length of %f is %f' % (self.length, a))


s = Square(2)
s.area()
